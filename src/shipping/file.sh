help me write dockerfile rust project
Sure! Below is an example of a Dockerfile for a Rust project. This Dockerfile will set up a Rust environment, copy your project files, build the project, and create a lightweight image to run the compiled binary.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Rust image as a build stage
FROM rust:latest AS builder
# Set the working directory inside the container
